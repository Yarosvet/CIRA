# CIRA: Catcher IMSI - Recognizer and Analyzer
You can capture IMSI addresses from the GSM tower using an RTL-SDR key. How about storing captured IMSI's in database? This tool can help you to compare your captures and show which IMSI's you've seen before.

# Run
**It requires gr-gsm installed and RTL-SDR connected**
```
pip3 install scapy scipy numpy
python3 main.py
```
